Overview and Objective
This project involves designing Finite State Machines (FSMs) using Verilog or VHDL in a VLSI software environment. FSMs are widely used in digital systems to control sequences of operations, such as traffic lights, vending machines, and communication protocols. The objective is to create, simulate, and verify FSM behavior, ensuring correct state transitions and outputs based on inputs.

Key Activities
Understand FSM Types: Explore Moore and Mealy machines and their applications.
State Diagram Design: Define states, inputs, outputs, and transitions using a state diagram.
Code Development: Write FSM logic in Verilog or VHDL using parameters and always blocks.
Testbench Creation: Develop testbenches to test different state transitions and outputs.
Simulation: Simulate the FSM in tools like ModelSim or Vivado and analyze results in the waveform viewer.
Debugging and Optimization: Identify and fix issues in state transitions or output logic.

Technologies and Tools
Programming Languages: Verilog or VHDL for FSM design.
Simulation Tools: ModelSim, Vivado, or Cadence for simulation and waveform analysis.
Documentation Tools: Word, PowerPoint for reporting.

Keysights and Outcomes
Accurate FSM design with verified state transitions and outputs.
Waveform analysis showing correct behavior under various input conditions.
Practical experience in designing and simulating FSMs for real-world applications.
A deeper understanding of FSM-based control systems for digital design projects.
